# Google Certificate Verification System Using Blockchain – BlockProof

BlockProof is a web-based application that verifies academic and skill certificates using Google authentication and blockchain technology. It ensures certificates are authentic, tamper-proof, and instantly verifiable.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Fake certificates and resume fraud are increasing rapidly. PDF certificates can be edited, duplicated, or forged easily. Employers and institutions lack a trusted, instant verification system.

## 💡 Solution
BlockProof uses:
- Google OAuth for verified identity
- Blockchain to store certificate hashes immutably
- QR code–based instant verification

Once a certificate is issued, it cannot be altered or faked.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Issuer logs in using Google
2. Certificate PDF is uploaded
3. System generates a SHA-256 hash
4. Hash is stored on blockchain
5. Certificate is stored securely
6. Verifier scans QR or enters Certificate ID
7. Blockchain validates authenticity
